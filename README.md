# Dijkstra
A golang implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm which is used to find the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, based on the description at [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm#Algorithm).
## Design
We implement this algorithm through a client-server format.<br>
- client.go <br> 
- server.go <br>

The solution is accessible via server.go.
